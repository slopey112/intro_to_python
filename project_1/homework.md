# Homework - Turtle Race
By now, you should have a working turtle race! For homework, I would like you to simply add some modifications. From the list below, pick 1 you would like to do and show me next class.
- Try the race with 8 turtles. (Please don't just do copy paste. There is a very quick way to do it.)
- Make the race track lines horizontal instead of vertical. (- instead of |)
- Flip everything! IE: Make the turtles go left instead of right, and make the race track on the left.
